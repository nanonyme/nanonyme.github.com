title: Getting things done
---

First for a very brief introduction. I'm Seppo Yli-Olli, a Finnish computer engineer.
I take great satisfaction from learning to use programming languages and that's pretty
much what I've been wasting last few years in. Luckily it also got me employed so I suppose
it's not a complete waste in that sense.

I've attempted - and failed - multiple times to set up a blog. I've gone through quite a few
but at this point it's time to face the fact that every single attempt in the end turned into
yet another software development project. Perhaps I just aren't the person to maintain their own
blog. This is probably my last try at this with Github pages. Given Github pages allow you to 
simply send flat markdown files which can be treated as markdowns, this might just be the thing.

Given much of the originall material like templates and css files are from 
http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, I'd like to point out my thanks in that direction.
